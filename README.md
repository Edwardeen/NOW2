🌍 NOW2: Turning Waste into Impact with Technology ♻️

I’m thrilled to share NOW2, a website application built to revolutionize waste management and philanthropy. This system enables individuals and organizations to donate waste to landfills, where it is transformed into monetary funds supporting WAQFs in Malaysia.

As the solo developer, I designed and implemented the system with a strong focus on modern web technologies, scalability, and user-centric design.

🔧 Technical Highlights:

TypeScript: Ensured type safety and scalability, making the system robust and maintainable.
Next.js: Delivered a seamless, server-rendered experience with high performance and flexibility.
Tailwind CSS: Created a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface for a smooth user experience.
NextAuth: Integrated a secure authentication framework to safeguard user data and ensure a trustworthy system.
Custom Authentication Methods: Designed and implemented self-made authentication for tailored security and functionality.
📂 System Features:

User-friendly donation flow for individuals and organizations.
Dynamic data management for tracking waste donations and fund allocations.
Scalable infrastructure to handle a growing user base and transaction volume.
🚀 Submission & Impact:
This project was submitted to the MTE 2024 International Competition as a competitive product, showcasing its innovative approach to sustainability and community development.

NOW2 represents the power of technology in bridging sustainability and philanthropy, offering a scalable, impactful solution to global challenges. 🌱

Special thanks to UNITEN for giving me the opportunity and Michael Immanuel for teaching me a few things about the technology behind the project.
